# Thanks
### A two-day solo project

*Thanks* is a project that lets the Hack Reactor family voice appreciation for the kind souls that have helped them along their journeys.
Take a moment today to thank someone who has made the world a little brighter.

## Iterative Project Breakdown
- [x] **MVP/Tier 1:**
    - Show a list of shoutouts, much like what we write in during Friday Retrospectives
    - There will be a form on the page to add shoutouts to the database, and the list will update with shoutouts
- [ ] **Tier 2:** 
    - Shoutout is converted to a visual shoutout map that has colored bubbles, each representing a shoutout
    - Hovering over the bubble will display the shoutout on the screen
    - Adding shoutouts displays new bubbles on the page with an animation
- [ ] **Tier 3:** 
    - Ability to sign shoutouts with a picture. The bubble will display a picture instead of the default solid color
    - Signed bubbles get unique colors as a ring around the picture
    - Each shoutout under the same name will receive the same color bubble
- [ ] **Tier 4:** 
    - Shoutouts are sorted by age, with older shoutouts receiving smaller bubbles.
- [ ] **Tier 5:** 
    - Physics engine for bubbles; they will now flow around the screen and respond to user mouse movement
